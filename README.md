# Creating the virtual teaching interface Login system

This login system allows users to create a personal page in the MVP. Users can register via name, email and password. Passwords are stored hashed in the database

## Software requirements

- NodeJS

## Installation and usage
The server uses several npm modules to work. These are:

- Axios
- Bcryptjs
- EJS
- Express
- Express-flash
- Express-session
- Method-override
- Passport
- Passport-local

To install the required modules run"

```bash
npm install
```
The login system is integrated in the MVP which runs on port 3002, but still has it's own server which runs on port 3001!
